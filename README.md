Chess bot and user interface built in Python. Runs by running the "Chess" file. Plays at around 1800 strength. The engine uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to find chose the best move. It searches to a base depth of at least 4, and then uses an additional quiescence search on the leaf nodes with "active positions". Supports player vs player, engine vs engine and player vs engine.
